            <p>Before the contest starts, everyone can choose whether or not they want to
                learn their opponents' Part 1 performance scores.
                These scores may give you a sense of how good (or bad) your competition is.
                    <BR><BR>
 If you choose to learn your opponents' scores, they will be shown to you before you start
                    competing against them.
            </p>

 Alternatively, you may choose to not know these scores before the competition.
<BR><BR>
Please think carefully about your choice and how it might affect your performance.
                When you feel confident that you understood these instructions, please proceed.
